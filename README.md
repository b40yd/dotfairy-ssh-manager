- [x] upload and download

# TODOs

# Install
You need install `quelpa.el`, `ssh-manager` using this package install. first:
```elisp
;; Use quelpa install packages
(use-package quelpa
  :init
  (setq quelpa-upgrade-p dotfairy-quelpa-upgrade
        quelpa-update-melpa-p nil
        quelpa-checkout-melpa-p nil
        quelpa-dir (expand-file-name "quelpa" user-emacs-directory)))

(use-package quelpa-use-package)
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'quelpa-use-package))
```
Now use-package will use `straight.el`.
```elisp
(use-package ssh-manager
  :ensure nil
  :quelpa (ssh-manager :fetcher github :repo "7ym0n/dotfairy-ssh-manager")
  :bind (("C-c m s s" . ssh-manager-switch-to-server)
        ("C-c m s u" . ssh-manager-upload-or-download-files-to-remote-host)
        ("C-c m s m" . ssh-manager)
        ("C-c M-s" . ssh-manager-show-ssh-session-groups))
  :init
  (setq ssh-manager-sshpass-path (expand-file-name "sshpass" user-emacs-directory)))

```
If you have many server management, it is recommended to use `auth-sources` configuration.
e.g `~/.emacs.d/.ssh/test.gpg`:
```elisp
host "demo"
kind "proxy"
proxy-host "localhost"
proxy-port "22"
proxy-user "root"
proxy-password ""
realhost "127.0.0.1"
port "22"
user "root"
password ""
totp-kind "FreeOTP"
totp-key ""
totp-message "verification code:"
```
If you have `TOTP`, you may also need to set `ssh-manager-totp-hooks`.
```elisp
;; eg. default custom totp-hooks
(setq ssh-manager-totp-hooks '((:name "Custom"
    :function (lambda (totp-key)
        (setq totp-key (read-string "Enter TOTP key: "))))))
```

Do not use proxy and TOTP, E.g:

```
host "demo"
kind ""
proxy-host ""
proxy-port "22"
proxy-user ""
proxy-password ""
realhost "120.10.10.10"
port "22"
user "root"
password "meiyoumima"
```

## Depends
- [sshpass](https://github.com/dora38/sshpass.git)
- oathtool
- rsync or scp
- ssh

Notes:

    choice scp upload or download files, it's don't show progress.

You can install sshpass through `ssh-manager-install-tools`.

MacOS:
```
brew install oath-tookit
# or
port install oath-tookit
```

Archlinux:
```
sudo pacman -Syy oath-tookit
```

debian:
```
sudo apt-get install oath-tookit
```

# Usage

1.  [ssh manager](#org3821008)
    1.  [batch an command line to remote server muilt-term](#org9746ee9)
    2.  [upload and download](#org0acc9e7)

Displays the buffer for batch execution of commands, use `M-x: ssh-manager-show-ssh-session-groups`.

SSH manager mode needs to be started for batch command execution. use `M-x: ssh-manager` or  open a file buffer, set `ssh-manager-mode`.

If you execute `ssh-manager-upload-or-download-files-to-remote-host` on the buffer, the current buffer file will be uploaded.
You need to upload a directory or multiple files. You need to enter `dired` and marked files or directory, after press the shortcut key `C-c C-<return>`.


## batch an command line to remote server muilt-term

-   `C-c C-a` add a term buffer to groups.
-   `C-c C-r` remove a term buffer to groups.
-   `C-c C-.` send current command line to all term of groups
-   `C-c C-c` send current buffer to all term of groups.
-   `C-c C-e` send region to all term of groups.
